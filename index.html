          This challenge is a little different than all of the others. Here we
          set the base styling that we will use for the rest of the challenges.

          This challenge involves a longer piece of text plus an image. The
          markup remains the same, while the layout changes significantly
          through the breakpoints.

          This challenge includes a layout seen on news sites. We have the top 5
          headlines of the day, arranged in different ways and with different
          elements at different breakpoints. For mobile, we scroll horizontally
          to see the options. Larger screen sizes may get fewer images and a
          different layout.

        <p>
          Many grid-based layouts arenâ€™t that interesting. What if they were? In
          this challenge, we start with a series of photos stacked of equal
          heights and widths. We move to a more interesting tablet layout and
          finish with a wild-looking desktop layout.

          Every website seems to have a page with a listing of team members.
          These may include names, titles, bios, and social media links. Why not
          mix these up and make them a little more fun?

          Cards are one of the most useful and pervasive patterns on the web.
          However, our layouts are often boring across breakpoints. Why not work
          with the space we have to make these layouts more interesting and
          compelling?
